      The Braze messaging API provides you with two distinct options for sending messages to your users. You can provide the message contents and configuration in the API request with the /messages/send and /messages/schedule endpoints. Alternatively, you can manage the details of your message with an API-Triggered Delivery campaign in the dashboard and just control when and to whom it is sent with the campaigns/trigger/send and campaigns/trigger/schedule endpoints. The following sections will detail the request specification for both methods.

      The examples below contain the URL https://rest.iad-01.braze.com, but some customers will need to use a different endpoint URL, for example if you are hosted in Braze’s EU data center or have a dedicated Braze installation. Your Success Manager will inform you if you should use a different endpoint URL.

      Similarly to other campaigns, you can limit the number of times a particular user can receive a Messaging API campaign by configuring re-eligibility settings in the Braze Dashboard. Braze will not deliver API messages to users that haven’t become re-eligible for the campaign regardless of how many API requests are sent.

      The User API allows you to track information on your users by logging data about your users that comes from outside your mobile app. You can also use this API to delete users for testing or other purposes.

      All API endpoints have a data payload limit of 4MB. Attempts to post more data than 4MB will fail with an HTTP 413 Request Entity Too Large.

      The examples below contain the URL https://rest.iad-01.braze.com, but some customers will need to use a different endpoint URL, for example if you are hosted in Braze’s EU data center or have a dedicated Braze installation. Your Success Manager will inform you if you should use a different endpoint URL.

  - name: User Data > External ID Migration
    description: The External ID Migration API allows you to rename existing external IDs (creating a new primary ID and deprecating the existing ID) and remove deprecated IDs post-migration. <br><br> We've architected this solution to allow multiple External IDs in order to support a migration period whereby older versions of your apps still in the wild that use the previous External ID naming schema don’t break. We highly recommend removing deprecated External IDs once your old naming schema is no longer in use.

      summary: Query Hard Bounced Emails
      description: |-
        This endpoint allows you to pull a list of email addresses that have “hard bounced” your email messages within a certain time frame.

        > **Note:** You must provide an `end_date`, as well as either an `email` or a `start_date`. If you provide all three, `start_date`, `end_date`, and an `email`, we prioritize the emails given and disregard the date range.

        If your date range has more than `limit` number of hard bounces, you will need to make multiple API calls, each time increasing the `offset` until a call returns either fewer than `limit` or zero results.

        ## Rate limit

        We apply the default Braze rate limit of 250,000 requests per hour to this endpoint, as documented in [API rate limits](https://www.braze.com/docs/api/api_limits/).

        ## Response

        Entries are listed in descending order.

      description: "This endpoint allows you to export data from any user profile by specifying a form of user identifier. Up to 50 `external_ids` or `user_aliases` can be included in a single request. Should you want to specify `device_id` or `email_address` only one of either identifier can be included per request.\n\n## Rate limit\n\nFor customers who onboarded with Braze on or after August 16, 2021, we apply a rate limit of 2,500 requests per minute to this endpoint, as documented in [API rate limits](https://www.braze.com/docs/api/api_limits/).\n\n## Request parameters\n\n| Parameter | Required | Data Type | Description |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| `external_ids` | Optional | Array of strings | External identifiers for users you wish export. |\n| `user_aliases` | Optional | Array of user alias object | [User aliases](https://www.braze.com/docs/api/objects_filters/user_alias_object/) for users to export. |\n| `device_id` | Optional | String | Device identifier, as returned by various SDK methods such as `getDeviceId`. |\n| `braze_id` | Optional | String | Braze identifier for a particular user. |\n| `email_address` | Optional | String | Email address of user. |\n| `phone` | Optional | String in [E.164](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E.164) format | Phone number of user. |\n| `fields_to_export` | Optional | Array of strings | Name of user data fields to export. Defaults to all if not provided. |\n\n### Fields to export\n\nThe following is a list of valid `fields_to_export`. Using `fields_to_export` to minimize the data returned can improve response time of this API endpoint:\n\n*   `apps`\n*   `attributed_campaign`\n*   `attributed_source`\n*   `attributed_adgroup`\n*   `attributed_ad`\n*   `braze_id`\n*   `campaigns_received`\n*   `canvases_received`\n*   `cards_clicked`\n*   `country`\n*   `created_at`\n*   `custom_attributes`\n*   `custom_events`\n*   `devices`\n*   `dob`\n*   `email`\n*   `email_subscribe`\n*   `external_id`\n*   `first_name`\n*   `gender`\n*   `home_city`\n*   `language`\n*   `last_coordinates`\n*   `last_name`\n*   `phone`\n*   `purchases`\n*   `push_subscribe`\n*   `push_tokens`\n*   `random_bucket`\n*   `time_zone`\n*   `total_revenue`\n*   `uninstalled_at`\n*   `user_aliases`\n    \n\nBe aware that the `/users/export/ids` endpoint will pull together the entire user profile for this user, including data such as all campaigns and Canvases received, all custom events performed, all purchases made, and all custom attributes. As a result, this endpoint is slower than other REST API endpoints.\n\nDepending on the data requested, this API endpoint may not be sufficient to meet your needs due to the 2,500 requests per minute rate limit. If you anticipate using this endpoint regularly to export users, instead consider exporting users by segment, which is asynchronous and more optimized for larger data pulls.\n\n### Response\n\n``` json\nContent-Type: application/json\nAuthorization: Bearer YOUR-REST-API-KEY\n{\n    \"message\": (required, string) the status of the export, returns 'success' when completed without errors,\n    \"users\" : (array of object) the data for each of the exported users, may be empty if no users are found,\n    \"invalid_user_ids\" : (optional, array of string) each of the identifiers provided in the request that did not correspond to a known user\n}\n\n```\n\nFor an example of the data that is accessible via this endpoint see the following example.\n\n### Sample user export file output\n\nUser export object (we will include the least data possible -

Using `fields_to_export` to minimize the data returned can improve response time of this API endpoint:\n\n*   `apps`\n*   `attributed_campaign`\n*   `attributed_source`\n*   `attributed_adgroup`\n*   `attributed_ad`\n*   `braze_id`\n*   `campaigns_received`\n*   `canvases_received`\n*   `cards_clicked`\n*   `country`\n*   `created_at`\n*   `custom_attributes`\n*   `custom_events`\n*   `devices`\n*   `dob`\n*   `email`\n*   `email_subscribe`\n*   `external_id`\n*   `first_name`\n*   `gender`\n*   `home_city`\n*   `language`\n*   `last_coordinates`\n*   `last_name`\n*   `phone`\n*   `purchases`\n*   `push_subscribe`\n*   `push_tokens`\n*   `random_bucket`\n*   `time_zone`\n*   `total_revenue`\n*   `uninstalled_at`\n*   `user_aliases`\n    \n\n### Important reminders\n\n*   The fields for `custom_events`, `purchases`, `campaigns_received`, and `canvases_received` will contain only contain data from the last 90 days.\n*   Both `custom_events` and `purchases` contain fields for `first` and `count`. Both of these fields will reflect information from all time, and will not be limited to just data from the last 90 days. For example, if a particular user first did the event prior to 90 days ago, this will be accurately reflected in the `first` field, and the `count` field will take into account events that occurred prior to the last 90 days as well.\n*   The number of concurrent segment exports a company can run at the endpoint level is capped at 100. Attempts that surpass this limit will result in an error.\n    \n\n### Response\n\n``` json\nContent-Type: application/json\nAuthorization: Bearer YOUR-REST-API-KEY\n{\n    \"message\": (required, string) the status of the export, returns 'success' when completed without errors,\n    \"object_prefix\": (required, string) the filename prefix that will be used for the JSON file produced by this export, e.g. 'bb8e2a91-c4aa-478b-b3f2-a4ee91731ad1-1464728599',\n    \"url\" : (optional, string) the URL where the segment export data can be downloaded if you do not have your own S3 credentials\n}\n\n```\n\nOnce made available, the URL will only be valid for a few hours.

      summary: Delete Scheduled API-Triggered Canvases
      description: |-
        The delete schedule endpoint allows you to cancel a message that you previously scheduled API-triggered Canvases before it has been sent.

        Scheduled messages or triggers that are deleted very close to or during the time they were supposed to be sent will be updated with best efforts, so last-second deletions could be applied to all, some, or none of your targeted users.

        ### Rate limit

        We apply the default Braze rate limit of 250,000 requests per hour to this endpoint, as documented in [API rate limits](https://www.braze.com/docs/api/api_limits/).

        | `canvas_id`| Required | String | See [Canvas identifier](https://braze.com/docs/api/identifier_types/). |
        | `schedule_id` | Required | String | The `schedule_id` to delete (obtained from the response to create schedule). |

        Use this endpoint to update scheduled API Triggered Campaigns, which are created on the Dashboard and initiated via the API. You can pass in `trigger_properties` that will be templated into the message itself.

        This endpoint allows you to send Campaign messages via API Triggered delivery, allowing you to decide what action should trigger the message to be sent. Please note that to send messages with this endpoint, you must have a Campaign ID, created when you build an [API-Triggered Campaign](https://www.braze.com/docs/api/api_campaigns/).

        Any schedule will completely overwrite the one that you provided in the create schedule request or in previous update schedule requests. For example, if you originally provide `"schedule" : {"time" : "2015-02-20T13:14:47", "in_local_time" : true}` and then in your update you provide `"schedule" : {"time" : "2015-02-20T14:14:47"}`, your message will now be sent at the provided time in UTC, not in the user's local time. Scheduled triggers that are updated very close to or during the time they were supposed to be sent will be updated with best efforts, so last-second changes could be applied to all, some, or none of your targeted users.

      summary: Create Send IDs For Message Send Tracking
      description: |-
        Braze’s Send Identifier adds the ability to send messages and track message performance entirely programmatically, without campaign creation for each send. Using the Send Identifier to track and send messages is useful if you are planning to programmatically generate and send content.

        ## Rate limit

        The daily maximum number of custom send identifiers that can be created via this endpoint is 100 for a given app group. Each `send_id` and `campaign_id` combination that you create will count towards your daily limit. The response headers for any valid request include the current rate limit status, see [API rate limits](https://www.braze.com/docs/api/api_limits/) for details.

When using this endpoint, you receive a single `dispatch_id` for an entire batched set of users. For more information on `dispatch_id` check out out our documentation on [Dispatch ID Behavior](https://www.braze.com/docs/help/help_articles/data/dispatch_id/).\n\n## Create send endpoint\n\n**Using the attributes object in campaigns**\n\nBraze has a Messaging Object called `Attributes` that will allow you to add, create, or update attributes and values for a user before you send them an API-triggered campaigns using the `campaign/trigger/send` endpoint as this API call will process the User Attributes object before it processes and sends the campaign. This helps minimize the risk of there being issues caused by [race conditions](https://www.braze.com/docs/help/best_practices/race_conditions/).\n\n> **Important:** Looking for the Canvas version of this endpoint?

      summary: Sending Canvas Messages via API Triggered Delivery
      description: "API-Triggered Delivery allows you to house message content inside of the Braze dashboard while dictating when a message is sent, and to whom via your API.\n\nThis endpoint allows you to send Canvas messages via API-Triggered delivery, allowing you to decide what action should trigger the message to be sent. Note that to send messages with this endpoint, you must have a Canvas ID, created when you build a [Canvas](https://www.braze.com/docs/api/identifier_types/#canvas-api-identifier).\n\n## Rate limit\n\nWhen specifying a segment or Connected Audience in your request, we apply a rate limit of 250 requests per minute to this endpoint. Otherwise, if specifying an `external_id`, this endpoint has a default rate limit of 250,000 requests per hour, as documented in [API rate limits](https://www.braze.com/docs/api/api_limits/).\n\nBraze endpoints support [batching API requests](https://www.braze.com/docs/api/api_limits/#batching-api-requests). A single request to the messaging endpoints can reach any of the following:\n\n*   Up to 50 specific `external_ids`, each with individual message parameters\n*   A segment of any size created in the Braze dashboard, specified by its `segment_id`\n*   An ad-hoc audience segment of any size, defined in the request as a [Connected Audience](https://www.braze.com/docs/api/objects_filters/connected_audience/) object\n    \n\n## Request parameters\n\n| Parameter | Required | Data Type | Description |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| `canvas_id` | Required | String | See [Canvas identifier](https://www.braze.com/docs/api/identifier_types/). |\n| `canvas_entry_properties` | Optional | Object | See [Canvas entry properties](https://www.braze.com/docs/api/objects_filters/canvas_entry_properties_object/). Personalization key-value pairs that will apply to all users in this request. The Canvas entry properties object has a maximum size limit of 50 KB. |\n| `broadcast` | Optional | Boolean | See [Broadcast](https://braze.com/docs/api/parameters/#broadcast). This parameter defaults to false (as of August 31, 2017).  <br>  <br>If `recipients` is omitted, `broadcast` must be set to true. However, use caution when setting `broadcast: true`, as unintentionally setting this flag may cause you to send your Canvas to a larger than expected audience. |\n| `audience` | Optional | Connected audience object | See [Connected audience](https://braze.com/docs/api/objects_filters/connected_audience/). |\n| `recipients` | Optional | Array | See [Recipients object](https://www.braze.com/docs/api/objects_filters/recipient_object/). If not provided and `broadcast` is set to true, the message will send to the entire segment targeted by the Canvas.  <br>  <br>The `recipients` array may contain up to 50 objects, with each object containing a single `external_user_id` string and `canvas_entry_properties` object. Either `external_user_id` or user_alias is required for this call. Requests must specify only one.  <br>  <br>When `send_to_existing_only` is true, Braze will only send the message to existing users—however this flag can’t be used with user aliases. When `send_to_existing_only` is `false` and a user with the given `id` does not exist, Braze will create a user with that ID and attributes before sending the message. |\n\nCustomers using the API for server-to-server calls may need to whitelist the appropriate API URL if they’re behind a firewall.\n\n> **Note:** If you include both specific users in your API call and a target segment in the dashboard, the message will send to specifically the user profiles that are in the API call and qualify for the segment filters.\n\n## Response details\n\nMessage sending endpoint responses will include the message’s `dispatch_id` for reference back to the dispatch of the message. The `dispatch_id` is the ID of the message dispatch (unique ID for each “transmission” sent from the Braze platform). Check out [Dispatch ID behavior](https://www.braze.com/docs/help/help_articles/data/dispatch_id/) for more information.\n\n## Create send endpoint\n\n**Using the Attributes Object in Canvas**\n\nBraze has a Messaging Object called `Attributes` that allows you to add, create, or update attributes and values for a user before sending them an API-Triggered Canvas using the `canvas/trigger/send` endpoint as this API call will process the User Attributes object before it processes and sends the Canvas. This helps minimize the risk of there being issues caused by [race conditions](https://www.braze.com/docs/help/best_practices/race_conditions/).\n\n> **Important:** Looking for the camaigns version of this endpoint?

      summary: Sending Transactional Email via API Triggered Delivery
      description: |-
        The Send Transactional Email endpoint allows you to send immediate, ad-hoc messages to a designated user. This endpoint is used alongside the creation of a [Transactional Email campaign](https://www.braze.com/docs/api/api_campaigns/transactional_campaigns) and corresponding campaign ID.

        > **Important:** Transactional Email is currently available as part of select Braze packages. Reach out to your Braze customer success manager for more details.

        Similar to the [Send Triggered Campaign endpoint](https://www.braze.com/docs/api/endpoints/messaging/send_messages/post_send_triggered_campaigns/), this campaign type allows you to house message content inside of the Braze dashboard while dictating when and to whom a message is sent via your API. Unlike the Send Triggered Campaign endpoint, which accepts an audience or segment to send messages to, a request to this endpoint must specify a single user either by `external_user_id` or `user_alias`, as this campaign type is purpose-built for 1:1 messaging of alerts like order confirmations or password resets.

        ## Rate limit

        Transactional Emails are not subject to a rate limit. Depending on your chosen package, a set number of Transactional Emails is covered per hour by SLA. Requests that exceed that rate will still send, but are not covered by SLA. 99.9% of emails will send in less than one minute.

        ## Request Parameters

        | Parameter | Required | Data Type | Description |
        | --- | --- | --- | --- |
        | `external_send_id` | Optional | String | A Base64 compatible string. Validated against the following regex `/^[a-zA-Z0-9-_+\/=]+$/`. This optional field allows you to pass an internal identifier for this particular send which will be included in events sent from the Transactional HTTP event postback. When passed, this identifier will also be used as a deduplication key, which Braze will store for 24 hours. Passing the same identifier in another request will not result in a new instance of a send by Braze for 24 hours. |
        | `trigger_properties` | Optional | Object | See [trigger properties](https://www.braze.com/docs/api/objects_filters/trigger_properties_object/). Personalization key-value pairs that will apply to the user in this request. |
        | `recipients` | Required | Object | The user you are targeting this message to. Can contain `attributes` and a single `external_user_id` or `user_alias`.  <br>  <br>Note that if you provide an external user ID that doesn’t already exist in Braze, passing any fields to the `attributes` object will create this user profile in Braze and send this message to the newly created user.  <br>  <br>If you send multiple requests to the same user with different data in the `attributes` object, Braze will ensure that `first_name`, `last_name`, and `email` attributes will be updated synchronously and templated into your message. Custom attributes don’t have this same protection, so proceed with caution when updating a user through this API and passing different custom attribute values in quick succession. |

        ## Response

        The send transactional email endpoint will respond with the message’s `dispatch_id` which represents the instance of this message send. This identifier can be used along with events from the Transactional HTTP event postback to trace the status of an individual email sent to a single user.

        ### Example response

        ``` json
        {
            "dispatch_id": Out-of-the-box generated Unique ID of the instance of this send
            "status": Current status of the message
            "metadata": Object containing additional information about the send instance
        }

        ```

        ### Transactional HTTP Event Postback

        All transactional emails are complemented with event status postbacks sent as an HTTP request back to your specified URL. This will allow you to evaluate the message status in real-time and take action to reach the user on another channel if the message goes undelivered, or fallback to an internal system if Braze is experiencing latency.

        In order to associate the incoming events to a particular instance of send, you can choose to either capture and store the Braze `dispatch_id` returned in the [API response](https://www.braze.com/docs/api/endpoints/messaging/send_messages/post_send_transactional_message/#example-response), or pass your own identifier to the `external_send_id` field. An example of a value you may choose to pass to that field may be an order ID, where after completing order 1234, an order confirmation message is triggered to the user through Braze, and `external_send_id : 1234` is included in the request. All following event postbacks such as `Sent` and `Delivered` will include `external_send_id : 1234` in the payload allowing you to confirm that user successfully received their order confirmation email.

        To get started using the Transactional HTTP Event Postback, navigate to **Manage Settings** > **Email Settings** > **Transactional Webpush URL** in your Braze dashboard and input your desired URL to receive postbacks.

        The following table lists possible returned errors and their associated troubleshooting steps, if applicable.

        | Error | Troubleshooting |
        | --- | --- |
        | Template name is required |
        | Tags must be an array | Tags must be formatted as an array of strings, for example `["marketing", "promotional", "transactional"]`. |
        | All tags must be strings | Make sure your tags are encapsulated in quotes (`""`). |
        | Some tags could not be found | To add a tag when creating an email template, the tag must already exist in Braze. |
        | Invalid value for `should_inline_css`. One of `true` or `false` was expected | This parameter only accepts boolean values (true or false). Make sure the value for `should_inline_css` is not encapsulated in quotes (`""`), which causes the value to be sent as a string instead. |

      description: |-
        > **Note:** For security purposes, this feature is disabled by default. To enable this feature, reach out to your customer success manager.

        Use this endpoint to remove your users' old deprecated external IDs. This endpoint completely removes the deprecated ID and cannot be undone.

        > You can send up to 50 external IDs per request.

        You will need to create a new [API key](https://www.braze.com/docs/api/api_key/) with permissions for this endpoint.

        ## Rate limit

        We apply a rate limit of 1,000 requests per minute to this endpoint, as documented in [API rate limits](http://braze.com/docs/api/api_limits/).

        ### Request parameters

        | Parameter | Required | Data Type | Description |
        | --- | --- | --- | --- |
        | `external_ids` | Required | Array of strings | External identifiers for the users to remove |

        > **Important:** Only deprecated IDs can be removed; attempting to remove a primary external ID will result in an error.

        ## Response

        The response will confirm all successful removals, as well as unsuccessful removals with the associated errors. Error messages in the `removal_errors` field will reference the index in the array of the original request.

        ``` json
        {
          "message" : (string) status message,
          "removed_ids" : (array of successful Remove Operations),
          "removal_errors": (array of any )
        }

        ```

        The `message` field will return `success` for any valid request. More specific errors are captured in the `removal_errors` array. The `message` field returns an error in the case of:

        *   Invalid API key
        *   Empty `external_ids` array
        *   `external_ids` array with more than 50 items
        *   Rate limit hit (>1,000 requests/minute)

      description: "> **Note:** For security purposes, this feature is disabled by default. To enable this feature, reach out to your customer success manager.\n\nUse this endpoint to “rename” your users’ external IDs. This endpoint sets a new (primary) `external_id` for the user and deprecates their existing `external_id`. This means that the user can be identified by either `external_id` until the deprecated one is removed. The deprecated ID can be removed using the [External ID remove](https://www.braze.com/docs/api/endpoints/user_data/external_id_migration/post_external_ids_remove) endpoint. Having multiple external IDs allows for a migration period whereby older versions of your apps still in the wild that use the previous external ID naming schema don’t break. We highly recommend removing deprecated external IDs once your old naming schema is no longer in use.\n\n> **Note:** You can send up to 50 external IDs per request.\n\nYou will need to create a new [API key](https://www.braze.com/docs/api/api_key/) with permissions for this endpoint.\n\n## Rate limit\n\nWe apply a rate limit of 1,000 requests per minute to this endpoint, as documented in [API rate limits](http://braze.com/docs/api/api_limits/).\n\n### Request parameters\n\n| Parameter | Required | Data Type | Description |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| `external_id_renames` | Required | Array of external ID rename objects | View request example and the following limitations for structure of external ID rename object |\n\n*   The `current_external_id` must be the user’s primary ID, and cannot be a deprecated ID\n*   The `new_external_id` must not already be in use as either a primary ID or a deprecated ID\n*   The `current_external_id` and `new_external_id` cannot be the same\n    \n\n## Response\n\nThe response will confirm all successful renames, as well as unsuccessful renames with any associated errors.

In fact, we highly recommend running a test migration on a staging or development app group, and ensuring everything has gone smoothly before executing on production data.\n\n**Does this consume data points?**  \nThis feature does not cost data points.\n\n**What is the recommended deprecation period?**  \nWe have no hard limit on how long you can keep deprecated external IDs around, but we highly recommend removing them once there is no longer a need to reference users by the deprecated ID."

        > **Note:** You can add up to 50 user aliases per request.

        __Adding a user alias for an existing user__ requires an `external_id` to be included in the new user alias object. If the `external_id` is present in the object but there is no user with that `external_id`, the alias will not be added to any users. If an `external_id` is not present, a user will still be created, but will need to be identified later. You can do this using the "Identifying Users" and the `users/identify` endpoint<br><br>__Creating a new alias-only user__ requires the `external_id` to be omitted from the new user alias object. Once the user is created, use the `/users/track` endpoint to associate the alias-only user with attributes, events and purchases, and the `/users/identify` endpoint to identify the user with an `external_id`.

        Use this endpoint to record custom events, purchases, and update user profile attributes.

        > **Note:** Braze processes the data passed via API at face value and customers should only pass deltas (changing data) to minimize unnecessary data point consumption. To read more, refer to [Data points](https://www.braze.com/docs/user_guide/onboarding_with_braze/data_points#data-points).

        Customers using the API for server-to-server calls may need to whitelist `rest.iad-01.braze.com` if they’re behind a firewall.

        ### Rate limit

        We apply a base speed limit of 50,000 requests per minute to this endpoint for all customers. Each request to the `/users/track` endpoint can contain up to 75 events, 75 attribute updates, and 75 purchases. Each component (event, attribute, and purchase arrays), can update up to 75 users each for a max of 225 individual data points. Each update can also belong to the same user for a max of 225 updates to a single user in a request.

        See our page on [API rate limits](https://www.braze.com/docs/api/api_limits/) for details, and reach out to your customer success manager if you need your limit increased.

        ### Request parameters

        > **Note:** For each of the request components listed in the following table, one of `external_id`, `user_alias`, or `braze_id` is required.

        | Parameter | Required | Data Type | Description |
        | --------- | ---------| --------- | ----------- |
        | `attributes` | Optional | Array of attributes objects | See [user attributes object](https://www.braze.com/docs/api/objects_filters/user_attributes_object/) |
        | `events` | Optional | Array of event objects | See [events object](https://www.braze.com/docs/api/objects_filters/event_object/) |
        | `purchases` | Optional | Array of purchase objects | See [purchases object](https://www.braze.com/docs/api/objects_filters/purchase_object/) |

        Keep the following nuances in mind when using the `/users/track` endpoint:

        * When creating alias-only users through this endpoint, you must explicitly set the `_update_existing_only` flag to `false`.
        * Updating the subscription status with this endpoint will both update the user specified by their `external_id` (such as User1) and update the subscription status of any users with the same email as that user (User1).

        ## User track responses

        Upon using any of the aforementioned API requests you should receive one of the following three general responses:

        #### Successful message

        Successful messages will be met with the following response:

        ```json
        {
          "message" : "success",
          "attributes_processed" : (optional, integer), if attributes are included in the request, this will return an integer of the number of external_ids with attributes that were queued to be processed,
          "events_processed" : (optional, integer), if events are included in the request, this will return an integer of the number of events that were queued to be processed,
          "purchases_processed" : (optional, integer), if purchases are included in the request, this will return an integer of the number of purchases that were queued to be processed,
        }
        ```

        #### Successful message with non-fatal errors

        If your message is successful but has non-fatal errors such as one invalid event object out of a long list of events, then you will receive the following response:

        ```json
        {
          "message" : "success",
          "errors" : [
            {
              <minor error message>
            }
          ]
        }
        ```

        #### Message with fatal errors

        In the case of a success, any data that was not affected by an error in the `errors` array will still be processed. If your message has a fatal error you will receive the following response:

        ```json
        {
          "message" : <fatal error message>,
          "errors" : [
            {
              <fatal error message>
            }
          ]
        }
        ```

        #### Fatal error response codes

        The following status codes and associated error messages will be returned if your request encounters a fatal error. Any of these error codes indicate that no data will be processed.

        | Error Code | Reason / Cause |
        | ---------------------| --------------- |
        | `400 Bad Request` | Bad Syntax. |
        | `401 Unauthorized` | Unknown or missing REST API Key. |
        | `404 Not Found` | Unknown REST API Key (if provided). |
        | `429 Rate Limited` | Over rate limit. |
        | `5XX` | Internal server error, you should retry with exponential backoff. |

        If you receive the error “provided external_id is blacklisted and disallowed”, your request may have included a “dummy user”. For more information, refer to [Spam blocking](https://www.braze.com/docs/user_guide/data_and_analytics/user_data_collection/user_archival/#spam-blocking).

        ###  Importing legacy user data

        You may submit data through the Braze API for a user who has not yet used your mobile app in order to generate a user profile. If the user subsequently uses the application all information following their identification via the SDK will be merged with the existing user profile you created via the API call. Any user behavior that is recorded anonymously by the SDK prior to identification will be lost upon merging with the existing API-generated user profile.

        The segmentation tool will include these users regardless of whether they have engaged with the app. If you want to exclude users uploaded via the User API who have not yet engaged with the app, simply add the filter: `Session Count > 0`.

        ### Making bulk updates

        If you have a use case where you need to make batch updates to the `users/track` endpoint, we recommend adding the bulk update header so that Braze can properly identify, observe, and route your request.

        Refer to the following sample request with the `X-Braze-Bulk` header:

        ```json
        curl --location --request POST 'https://rest.iad-01.braze.com/users/track' \
        --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
        --header 'X-Braze-Bulk: true' \
        --header 'Authorization: Bearer YOUR-API-KEY-HERE' \
        --data-raw '{ "attributes": [ ], "events": [ ], "purchases": [ ] }'
        ```

        > **Warning:** When the `X-Braze-Bulk` header is present with any value, Braze will consider the request a bulk request. Set the value to `true`. Currently, setting the value to `false` does not disable the header—it will still be treated as if it were true.

        #### Use cases

        Consider the following use cases where you may use the bulk update header:

        * A daily job where multiple users’ custom attributes are updated via the `/users/track` endpoint.
        * An ad-hoc user data backfill script which updates user information via the `/users/track` endpoint.
