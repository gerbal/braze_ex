# Development

This API is generated using [OpenApiGenerator](https://openapi-generator.tech/) from the [Braze Postman Collection](https://documenter.getpostman.com/view/4689407/SVYrsdsG).

Requirements: 
 - [asdf](https://asdf-vm.com/), which installs all of the necessary tools and versions
 - [just](https://just.systems/man/en/), which runs the build scripts from the [justfile](justfile)
